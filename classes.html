Search The Body Coach on YouTube at 9am to take part.</p>

<p class="lead"> <strong> Phonics</strong></p>

<p class="lead">Today we are exploring the diagraph th. If you possibly can watch Mr Thorne does phonics th episode on YouTube. Please complete the th phonics challenge.</p>

<p class="lead"><strong>Other activities you can do</strong> – How many words containing th can you think of in 1 minute. Could you practice writing your tricky words. Perhaps you could choose a book and see how many tricky words you can spot. You can play on the phonicsplay games for free while the schools are closed.</p>

<p class="lead"><strong>Maths</strong></p>

<p class="lead">Did you manage to sequence all the numbers correctly yesterday? How about finding all the missing numbers? Today we thought you might like to singalong with the big numbers song. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0dJWfQHF8Y</p>

<p class="lead">Mrs Hughes and her family love playing 21. With a grown up or a sibling take it in turns to count on (no more than 4 numbers at a time) until you reach 21. Eg player 1…. 1,2,3  player 2…4,5…… player 1….6,7,8,9 player 2… 10, 11, 12, 13 etc until you reach 21. Challenge – Can you play the game backwards counting back from 21?</p>

<p class="lead">Have a go at completing the caterpillar sheet included in your pack.</p>

<p class="lead">There are some great sequencing games available  on https://www.topmarks.co.uk/maths-games/5-7-years/ordering.</p>
<p class="lead">
<strong>Literacy</strong>

<p class="lead">Please find your Gingerbread Man on week 1 activity 3. Carefully follow the lines with your pencil. Before you begin check you are holding your pencil correctly, take your time and do not rush. Can you retell the story of the Gingerbread Man to someone in your house? Could you teach them the actions?  Line up all your toys and perform the story to them. <strong>Challenge</strong>– Can you rewrite the story of the Gingerbread Man in your workbook.</p>

<p class="lead">Please see the attached letter regarding Oxfordowl and supporting your child with their reading at home. We snuggled down and watched the Cbeebies bedtime story last night.</p>

<p class="lead">Other activitiesWe hope you are enjoying these activities , please continue  to choose from these each day. Our children have been helping to set the table each mealtime.  We managed to get out for a walk as our daily exercise when no one else was about and looked for signs of Spring. Then we came straight home and painted some of the things we saw. It made us feel really happy.</p>

<p class="lead"><strong>Have a wonderful day. Keep smiling, washing your hands and being as kind as can be. Stay safe.</strong></p>

<p class="lead"><strong> Love the FS team J  xxx</strong></p>

 

<p class="lead">On this page you will find out about what we have been learning, finding out and doing.</p>

<p class="lead">Reception is a very important year at school and within the year we aim to provide the children with the tools that they need to ensure they have a successful learning journey at Marlborough. The children learn the values that are important to us at both Marlborough and in the wider community, to take responsibility for their actions, to be tolerant and understanding as well as how to enjoy their learning and work in harmony with others.</p>

<p class="lead">We hope you enjoy discovering what life is like at Marlborough. As ever if you have any questions please feel free to come in and chat to us after school.</p> <a href="http://www.marlborough.cheshire.sch.uk/themes/marlborough/images/logo.png"><small class="small text-muted">(Source) </small> </a>

<p class="lead">Mrs Hughes and her family love playing 21. With a grown up or a sibling take it in turns to count on (no more than 4 numbers at a time) until you reach 21. Eg player 1…. 1,2,3  player 2…4,5…… player 1….6,7,8,9 player 2… 10, 11, 12, 13 etc until you reach 21. Challenge – Can you play the game backwards counting back from 21?</p>

<p class="lead">Have a go at completing the caterpillar sheet included in your pack.</p>

<p class="lead">There are some great sequencing games available  on https://www.topmarks.co.uk/maths-games/5-7-years/ordering.</p>
<p class="lead">

Before you begin check you are holding your pencil correctly, take your time and do not rush. Can you retell the story of the Gingerbread Man to someone in your house? Could you teach them the actions?  Line up all your toys and perform the story to them. <strong>Challenge</strong>– Can you rewrite the story of the Gingerbread Man in your workbook.</p>

<p class="lead">Please see the attached letter regarding Oxfordowl and supporting your child with their reading at home. We snuggled down and watched the Cbeebies bedtime story last night.</p>

<p class="lead">Other activitiesWe hope you are enjoying these activities , please continue  to choose from these each day. Our children have been helping to set the table each mealtime.  We managed to get out for a walk as our daily exercise when no one else was about and looked for signs of Spring. Then we came straight home and painted some of the things we saw. It made us feel really happy.</p>

<p class="lead"><strong>Have a wonderful day. Keep smiling, washing your hands and being as kind as can be. Stay safe.</strong></p>

<p class="lead">On this page you will find out about what we have been learning, finding out and doing.</p>

<p class="lead">Reception is a very important year at school and within the year we aim to provide the children with the tools that they need to ensure they have a successful learning journey at Marlborough. The children learn the values that are important to us at both Marlborough and in the wider community, to take responsibility for their actions, to be tolerant and understanding as well as how to enjoy their learning and work in harmony with others.</p>

<p class="lead">We hope you enjoy discovering what life is like at Marlborough. As ever if you have any questions please feel free to come in and chat to us after school.</p> <a href="http://www.marlborough.cheshire.sch.uk/themes/marlborough/images/logo.png"><small class="small text-muted">(Source) </small> </a>
